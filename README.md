# Welcome!

I'm a **Quantitative Fisheries Scientist** with a focus on _Pacific salmon assessment, management, and conservation_. 

## My Interests

* **Population dynamics** and models that describe them
* **Methods for counting animals** and the models we use to make sense of the data
* **Bayesian analysis** as a means to quantify knowledge and uncertainty
* **State-space models** as a means to disentangle biological and observational processes
* **Transparent and data-driven decision processes** because regardless of the outcome, it should always be clear why a choice was made
* **Reproducible workflows** because analyses are rarely ever "finished"

        Preseason forecasts of Pacific salmon run size are notoriously uncertain and are thus often updated using various abundance indices collected during the run. However, interpretation of these in-season indices is confounded by uncertainty in migration timing. We assessed the performance of two Bayesian information-updating procedures for Kuskokwim River Chinook salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</em>), one that uses auxiliary run timing information and one that does not, and compared the performance with methods that did not involve updating. We found that in-season Bayesian updating provided more accurate run size estimates during the time when harvest decisions needed to be made, but that the incorporation of run timing forecasts had little utility in terms of providing more accurate run size estimates. The latter finding is conditional on the performance of the run timing forecast model we used; a more accurate timing forecast model might yield a different conclusion. The Bayesian approach we developed provided a probabilistic expression of run size beliefs, which could be useful in a transparent risk-assessment framework for setting and altering harvest targets during the season.

    <p>
        Detailed information regarding migratory behavior (i.e., phenology and rate of travel) of specific Pacific salmon <em>Oncorhynchus</em> spp. substocks can be used to design management strategies focused on protecting substocks from harvest when desired; however, this information is often lacking. The Kwethluk and Kisaralik rivers are two tributaries of the lower Kuskokwim River that originate and flow through the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge in western Alaska. Although these two systems are the primary Chinook Salmon–producing tributaries within the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge, little is known about migratory behavior of Chinook Salmon destined for these rivers. In 2015 and 2016, 119 Chinook Salmon tagged with radio telemetry transmitters entered either the Kwethluk or Kisaralik Rivers and were tracked throughout their migration to their assumed final spawning location using both ground- and aerial-based tracking methods. We compared migration timing and swim speeds between fish bound for these two rivers and between fish of different sizes and compared the consistency among the 2 y. In general, we found that fish bound for the Kwethluk and Kisaralik rivers exhibited similar migration behaviors in 2015 and 2016, including entry timing into the Kuskokwim River and migration rates once in the tributaries. A key finding was that Chinook Salmon swam fastest (range of means between years: 20–45 km/d) in the main-stem Kuskokwim River and slowed significantly (4–15 km/d) upon entry into lower portions of the tributaries. Our findings have relevance for harvest management strategies; for example, temporal fishery closures will impact Chinook Salmon bound for both the Kwethluk and Kisaralik rivers equally given their broad overlap in entry timing, and individuals will remain vulnerable to harvest for longer periods when located in tributaries rather than the portion of the main-stem directly below the tributary confluences.
