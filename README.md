    <p>
        Salmon populations harvested in mixed-stock fisheries can exhibit genotypic, behavioral, and life history diversity that can lead to heterogeneity in population productivity and size. Methods to quantify this heterogeneity among populations in mixed-stock fisheries are not well-established but are critical to assessing harvest–biodiversity trade-offs when setting harvest policies. We developed an integrated, age-structured, state-space model that allows for more complete use of available data and sharing of information than simpler methods. We compared a suite of state-space models of varying structural complexity to simpler regression-based approaches and, as an example case, fitted them to data from 13 Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) populations in the Kuskokwim drainage in western Alaska. We found biological and policy conclusions were largely consistent among state-space models but differed strongly from regression-based approaches. Simulation trials illustrated our state-space models were largely unbiased with respect to spawner–recruit parameters, abundance states, and derived biological reference points, whereas the regression-based approaches showed substantial bias. These findings suggest our state-space model shows promise for informing harvest policy evaluations of harvest–biodiversity trade-offs in mixed-stock salmon fisheries.

    <p>
        Accounting for population diversity can be critical to the sustainable management of mixed-stock fisheries because harvest rates that can be sustained by productive populations may come at the cost of overfishing less productive ones. While these harvest–diversity trade-offs are well-recognized, their consequences for harvest policy performance are not often explicitly evaluated in contemporary fisheries management. We use closed-loop simulations to evaluate the ability of alternative harvest policies to meet population diversity and fishery objectives for one of the largest subsistence Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) fisheries in the world (Kuskokwim River Basin in western Alaska). We found clear evidence of population diversity that resulted in asymmetric trade-offs among fishery and conservation objectives whereby policies that forgo relatively small amounts of harvest result in relatively large increases in equitable access to Chinook and elimination of risk of weak stock extirpation. The performance of alternative harvest policies, and the magnitude of trade-offs, were sensitive to regime shifts and uncertainty in the drivers of recruitment variation. However, we found that harvest policies that prioritized meeting minimum subsistence needs were unlikely to jeopardize long-term sustainability.

    <p>
        Preseason forecasts of Pacific salmon run size are notoriously uncertain and are thus often updated using various abundance indices collected during the run. However, interpretation of these in-season indices is confounded by uncertainty in migration timing. We assessed the performance of two Bayesian information-updating procedures for Kuskokwim River Chinook salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</em>), one that uses auxiliary run timing information and one that does not, and compared the performance with methods that did not involve updating. We found that in-season Bayesian updating provided more accurate run size estimates during the time when harvest decisions needed to be made, but that the incorporation of run timing forecasts had little utility in terms of providing more accurate run size estimates. The latter finding is conditional on the performance of the run timing forecast model we used; a more accurate timing forecast model might yield a different conclusion. The Bayesian approach we developed provided a probabilistic expression of run size beliefs, which could be useful in a transparent risk-assessment framework for setting and altering harvest targets during the season.

    <p>
        Detailed information regarding migratory behavior (i.e., phenology and rate of travel) of specific Pacific salmon <em>Oncorhynchus</em> spp. substocks can be used to design management strategies focused on protecting substocks from harvest when desired; however, this information is often lacking. The Kwethluk and Kisaralik rivers are two tributaries of the lower Kuskokwim River that originate and flow through the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge in western Alaska. Although these two systems are the primary Chinook Salmon–producing tributaries within the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge, little is known about migratory behavior of Chinook Salmon destined for these rivers. In 2015 and 2016, 119 Chinook Salmon tagged with radio telemetry transmitters entered either the Kwethluk or Kisaralik Rivers and were tracked throughout their migration to their assumed final spawning location using both ground- and aerial-based tracking methods. We compared migration timing and swim speeds between fish bound for these two rivers and between fish of different sizes and compared the consistency among the 2 y. In general, we found that fish bound for the Kwethluk and Kisaralik rivers exhibited similar migration behaviors in 2015 and 2016, including entry timing into the Kuskokwim River and migration rates once in the tributaries. A key finding was that Chinook Salmon swam fastest (range of means between years: 20–45 km/d) in the main-stem Kuskokwim River and slowed significantly (4–15 km/d) upon entry into lower portions of the tributaries. Our findings have relevance for harvest management strategies; for example, temporal fishery closures will impact Chinook Salmon bound for both the Kwethluk and Kisaralik rivers equally given their broad overlap in entry timing, and individuals will remain vulnerable to harvest for longer periods when located in tributaries rather than the portion of the main-stem directly below the tributary confluences.

    <p>
        Annual variation in adult salmon migration timing makes the interpretation of in-season assessment data difficult, leading to much in-season uncertainty in run size. We developed and evaluated a run timing forecast model for the Kuskokwim River Chinook salmon stock, located in western Alaska, intended to aid in reducing this source of uncertainty. An objective and adaptive approach (using model-averaging and a sliding window algorithm to select predictive time periods, both calibrated annually) was adopted to deal with multidimensional selection of four climatic variables and was based entirely on predictive performance. Forecast cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of three forecasting approaches: the null (i.e., intercept only) model, the single model with the lowest mean absolute error, and a model-averaged forecast across 16 nested linear models. As of 2016, the null model had the lowest mean absolute error (2.64 days), although the model-averaged forecast performed as well or better than the null model in the majority of retrospective years. The model-averaged forecast had a consistent mean absolute error regardless of the type of year (i.e., average or extreme early/late) the forecast was made for, which was not true of the null model. The availability of the run timing forecast was not found to increase overall accuracy of in-season run assessments in relation to the null model, but was found to substantially increase the precision of these assessments, particularly early in the season.

    <p>
        Stock assessment scientists are faced with decisions regarding how to incorporate fishery information into models. One primary decision revolves around how estimates that are summaries of raw data should be treated (e.g., abundance estimates derived from relative indices). The choice in this case is to either use estimates from a sequence of models as data in a final model (i.e., the model used for setting management goals) or to integrate the raw data into a more complex final model. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages that constitute a suite of trade-offs. These trade-offs are investigated here by comparing two sequential analyses (one that ignores measurement error and one that incorporates it) to an integrated analysis for a stock assessment of Pacific salmon using simulation-estimation, and the Kuskokwim River Chinook salmon stock of western Alaska as a case study. The major difference between approaches was that an abundance reconstruction was estimated separately from the spawner-recruit analysis in the sequential approaches, whereas the integrated approach did so in a single model. Primary findings showed that approaches that addressed the measurement error in the raw data returned very similar estimates of abundance, population dynamics parameters, and management reference points, both in terms of point estimates and uncertainty. When measurement error was ignored, similar point estimates were returned. However, this approach underestimated uncertainty in the spawner-recruit analysis but resulted in more uncertainty in the abundance reconstruction. These findings were consistent for both the Kuskokwim River case study and simulation-estimation analyses. The primary advantage of the integrated analysis was the added realism of sharing calendar year abundance data among brood years, but came at the cost of slow model run times. This exercise showed that while there is a trade-off between sequential and integrated analyses in terms of model complexity and realism, the benefits may not be large enough to warrant an integrated analysis in all cases, given that the terminal model carries forward uncertainty in the input estimates.

    <p>
        The occurrence of Asiatic Weatherfish, <em>Misgurnus anguillicaudatus</em>, in Alabama, a state known for its rich biodiversity, has generated concern among conservation managers. The current study used respirometry techniques to investigate the effects of increasing temperature on four native southeastern fishes (one cyprinid, two percids, and one elassomid) and the non-native <em>M. anguillicaudatus</em>. A minimum of five individuals of each species were used, and three experimental temperatures were chosen to represent spring and summer averages of northeast Alabama streams (15, 20, and 25°C). Overall, mean standard metabolic rates (SMRs) for <em>M. anguillicaudatus</em> were low (97.01, 127.75, and 158.50 mg O<sub>2</sub> kg<sup>-1</sup>h<sup>-1</sup> at 15, 20, and 25°C, respectively); <em>M. anguillicaudatus</em> was the only species for which SMR did not significantly increase with temperature (p = 0.467). In contrast, mean SMRs for all native species examined were higher than <em>M. anguillicaudatus</em> rates at a given temperature, and mean SMRs for <em>Cyprinella caerulea</em>, <em>Etheostoma brevirostrum</em>, and <em>Etheostoma ditrema</em> exhibited significant increases in SMR when temperatures were increased (e.g. 403.46, 704.42, and 1150.03 mg O<sub>2</sub> kg<sup>-1</sup>h<sup>-1</sup> at 25°C, respectively) (p &lt; 0.01). <em>Elassoma zonatum</em> displayed highly significant increases in SMR when temperature increased from 15-20°C (p &lt; 0.001). Overall, the abiotic tolerances of <em>M. anguillicaudatus</em> may facilitate further establishment that could lead to negative impacts on native species.
